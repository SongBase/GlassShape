Glass Shutters for Sash Windows

**_[Website](http://glassshape.uk/)_**

Application for generating CAD scripts for drawing Glass Shutters for sash windows.

Glass Shutters may be used as an alternative to double glazing where it is required to preserve the appearance of your traditional sash windows.

The glass is toughened and has a coating which reflects heat back into the room while still letting in heat from the sun.

The frameless panels are easily opened to allow access to the window. By choosing an appropriate style, the panel divisions can be made to coincide with the glazing bars. This minimizes the visual impact of the panels from inside while making them virtually invisible from the outside.
